PROMPT:
You are an expert web designer and developer, I would like to recreate the website design that I have provided in the attached image using HTML and CSS and needs to be responsive as well. The website belongs to my company, Stylish park, and it serves as a hair cutting and facial center which provides many requests like cutting, shaving and dying hair and this is my logo for the website https://ibb.co/rGxG4zLk. The webpage is divided into a total of 4 sections, and I’ll provide you with each section, You should not use the same content. Change the content that aligns to my brand. Provide me the code and guide on where to integrate it.

There are 4 sections in the attached image, Such as the header,what services we're providing,how we give priority to people's requests and filters(sort by section)and contact information.fist the header contains our service name with little description about it, secondly the service section contains information about what services we're providing which needs to be clear and with some visual images,thirdly the sort by section contains services based on their preferences and finally an ending phase with greetings and contact info(like mobile number and email ID and address of the shop). The image you should incorporate into the design is this: .https://ibb.co/ZzJ0rH9P and this https://ibb.co/RTYkWBJk.

You can use online svg for icons if required from Font awesome.

Feel free to choose fonts that align with our brand identity and apply your expertise to enhance the overall styling of the website. I intend to use the CodePen application for copying and pasting the code. Please advise me on what to name the HTML and CSS files.

To begin, please ask any essential questions that will help you better understand the website design. Let’s communicate in English for this project.
